In this project the overall goal of making a planner that is able to plan a path in the given environment, with the given constraint was achieved. The result was a modified RRT-connect algorithm with expansion of constraint checking. The constraint was given in the exercise. The result of this was a pretty reliable connection algorithm that was able to find a trajectory in most cases. The test that was made to test the algorithm, all validated that it works at it should. It means that our planner ensures that trajectories inside the constraint areas were moving away of the human center and avoidance of the constraint area if both Qinit and Qgoal were outside of the constraint area. Even though it hasn't been fully tested and can still have small bugs.
